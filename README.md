# hCard

This is an app serving my hCard at [sigurdhsson.org](http://sigurdhsson.org).
In addition to doing that, it serves 301/410 messages on some URLs, since some old things are now gone and some (including [my blog](http://blog.sigurdhsson.org) and [Webboken](http://webboken.github.io)) have moved permanently.

All HTML content is validated using a Travis CI setup.
